# myContacts

A simple contacts app that allows a user to load their stored contacts to be displayed on screen. Built with Flutter.

# Features

- Search Functionality
  - A user can filter through their contacts with the help of a search bar.
  
- Scrollable Contacts List with Sections
  - Each section is labled in alphabetical order.
  - Example: The 'B' section has all contacts whose name begin with 'B'.
  
- Dynamic Header
  - The user's contact card is the first card to appear before the user's contact list.
  
    - This card contains a `photo`, `name` and `description` of the user. 
    - These values can be set in Settings. (coming soon)
    
- Phone Calls / SMS
  - After clicking on a contact card, the user can reach the contact either via direct phone call or SMS.
  
- Clean Architecture
  - The source code for this project is cleanly written and follows best practices.
